## Galaxy challenges

* building indeces for mappers
* upload of large files (use FTP!)
	* symlinking is probably enough, but right now only admins can do this

## Simple Workflow - NY Genome Center

* STAR
* featurecount
* DESeq2

## Extended

* options for adapter removal and quality trimming
* edgeR, limma + voom

## Legacy

* provide Tophat2 and BWA as fall-back mappers
